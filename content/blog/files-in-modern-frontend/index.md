Web development has gotten quite complex in today's age.
This article aims to shed some light on what happens to the source code from the time it is written to the time it is converted to 
pixels on user's browser.

## Building
- Transpiling
- Splitting
  - Bundle
  - Code
- Uglification
- Minification

Developers using the modern frontend methodologies usually code in technologies that usually don't run in browser.  
Hence they have to be transpiled(processing code from one source to another in same or different language).
Babel helps us to do that.
We can transpile
